CareerCatalyst is designed to generate personalized job recommendation emails based on uploaded job descriptions and resumes. Streamlit serves as both the frontend and backend, providing an intuitive interface for users to upload resumes and job descriptions. Once uploaded, Streamlit processes the files by parsing the data to extract relevant information. The LLaMA Model, a large language model (LLM), analyzes the parsed data and generates tailored job recommendation emails based on the extracted information.
